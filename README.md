# SQL_note_and_Prac
## About the repository:
It is a archive for the note and possible practice for sql **FOR MY OWN USE**<br/>
Therefore, the note can be tricking and hard to understand.
## Source:
https://sqlbolt.com/  (easy to understand with interactive quiz, however, downside is that it is not finished)<br/>
https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial (tons of practice that you can use!)
